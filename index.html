            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

          <h3>Start with asking why</h3>
          <p class="logop">
            You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
            effective ways of achieving goals.

          <p class="logop" id="rightP1">
            Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
            frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

            By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will
            be fresher and more valuable.

          <p class="logop" id="rightP2">
            As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that‚Äôs not
            finished or doesn‚Äôt look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback
            and learn from it.

        The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to
        create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the
        result to the community.

            It has to be a problem that‚Äôs personally affecting or affected you,
            like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering
            something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close
            attention to your surroundings.

          <h4>Think about the solution</h4>
          <p>
            It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these
            problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook and
            start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

          <p>
            How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
            features and functionality, and then start designing. Don‚Äôt forget
            to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
